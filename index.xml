it&amp;rsquo;s simple and fast it works well with a tiling window manager it has a very cool feature: selection mode The project has not been updated since June 2019 and uses a patched version of VTE, so it needed an update.
Cherry picking cool PR Several pull request were interesting:
Enable drag and drop text into termite from another program which I then upgraded to handle drag and drop of file to terminal.</description></item><item><title>I'm Julien</title><link>https://barb.uk/about/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 15:41:24 +0400</pubDate><guid>https://barb.uk/about/</guid><description>Linux system engineer at 772424.com, I love tinkering with open source project.
